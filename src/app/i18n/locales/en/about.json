  "aboutContent": "A self-motivated and career-focused software developer with a strong specialization in blockchain development and open-source contributions. Currently expanding my knowledge in zero-knowledge (zk) proofs, exploring their applications in enhancing privacy and scalability in blockchain systems. My expertise lies in building efficient and secure systems, with a strong focus on clean code practices, optimization, and code readability. I prioritize writing maintainable and scalable solutions. Primarily working with technologies like Rust, Next.js, TypeScript and Python. While I dedicate most of my time to blockchain technologies, zk technologies, and smart contracts, I also continually improve my backend and frontend development skills. On the backend, I work with technologies like microservice architecture, CI/CD pipelines, RESTful APIs, and GraphQL. On the frontend, I focus on creating user-friendly interfaces using modern tools like React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. Additionally, I enjoy creating fun projects and experimenting with various startup ideas.",
